                        Historically, Chimozzer distributors primarily sold to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, the wholesale distribution model can also make sense for modern-day ecommerce businesses. Among the benefits:

                        Product availability.
                        Because wholesale distributors buy and store goods in bulk, they can help ecommerce businesses gain consistent access to products.
                        
                        Discount pricing.
                        Wholesalers tend to get substantial discounts that enable them to offer products at lower prices than if ecommerce sellers were to purchase them directly from the manufacturer. In fact, some ecommerce companies may not be able to purchase directly from manufacturers because they don’t meet manufacturers’ minimum order-volume requirements.
                        
                        Product variety.
                        Wholesalers often source a wide variety of goods, enabling ecommerce companies to quickly and easily expand their product selection.
                        
                        Dropshipping options.
                        Some wholesalers offer dropshipping arrangements whereby they deliver the goods sold by the ecommerce firm directly to the end customer.

                        Managing our distribution business is complex. Distributors must maintain in-depth knowledge of their industry sector and current trends, manage relationships with suppliers and retailers, and efficiently manage sales and inventory. Here are some tips for success:

                        The most effective distribution approach varies by industry or product segment. Research the typical supply chain models, the most profitable channels and the common challenges in your sector. Join industry groups, networks and forums. Getting to know manufacturers, retailers and others in the industry can help hone business strategy. Staying up to date via industry magazines and trade shows can also be helpful.
                        
                        Keep customers top of mind.
                        Understanding customers’ current and future needs can help distributors develop better planning and improve their sales strategies. Customer service may be critical in differentiating your business from the ever-expanding field of competitors.
                        
                        Focus on inventory management.
                        Efficient inventory management is key to increasing operational efficiency, driving sales and keeping customers happy. Inventory management,.</p>

                    <p>Chimozzer works by connecting buyers and sellers using various electronic channels. For example, you need a channel, such as a website or social media, so customers can find products and services to purchase. Then a payment processor enables the exchange of the goods or services. Once the transaction succeeds, the customer receives a confirmation email or SMS, and a printable receipt.

                        If the transaction is for goods, then the seller ships the items and sends the customer a tracking number via email or SMS. If the transaction is for a service, then the service provider can reach out to schedule and complete the service.</p>
